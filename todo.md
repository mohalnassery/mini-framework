## Additional Suggestions for Excellence

1. **Implement the `off` Method in the Events System**

   - Currently, your event system lacks the ability to remove event listeners. Implementing the `off` method will allow users to remove event handlers, providing more control and preventing potential memory leaks.

2. **Optimize State Comparison Logic**

   - Enhance the `setState` method in `state.js` to perform a deep comparison between the previous and new state. This will prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

3. **Improve Virtual DOM Diffing Algorithm**

   - Currently, the `render` function replaces the entire DOM subtree. Implement a more sophisticated diffing algorithm to compare the old and new virtual DOM trees and update only the parts that have changed.

4. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling**

   - Include error handling in your framework to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This will improve the robustness of your application.

5. **Enhance Documentation**

   - Expand your documentation to include more detailed explanations of internal workings, design decisions, and advanced usage scenarios. Include diagrams or flowcharts if possible.

6. **Implement Unit Tests**

   - Write unit tests for all modules (`dom.js`, `state.js`, `router.js`, `events.js`) to ensure code reliability and facilitate future maintenance.

7. **Ensure Inversion of Control**

   - Verify that your framework calls the user code (not the other way around), emphasizing the inversion of control characteristic of frameworks.

8. **Refine Code Quality**

   - Review your code to ensure it adheres to best practices, such as consistent naming conventions, modularity, and code comments where necessary.

9. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Optimize event delegation in `events.js` for better performance with a large number of elements.
   - Cache DOM elements or use memoization where appropriate.

10. **Accessibility Improvements**

    - Enhance the TodoMVC application to be accessible, including ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.

11. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**

    - Test your application in different browsers and ensure it works consistently across all of them.

12. **Avoid Using Restricted Methods**

    - Ensure that your event handling does not rely on `addEventListener` directly, as per the project requirements.

## Will You Pass the Audit Questions?

Based on your current implementation:

- **Functional Requirements:**

  - **Framework Implementation Without Prohibited Libraries:** ✅ Yes, your framework does not use any high-level libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.

  - **Documentation:**

    - Written in Markdown: ✅ Yes.
    - Contains a top-level overview: ✅ Yes.
    - Includes explanations and code examples on how to create an element, add attributes, create an event, and nest elements: ✅ Yes.
    - Explains how the framework works: ✅ Partially. Could be expanded with more details.

  - **TodoMVC Project:**

    - Contains all elements present in standard TodoMVC examples: ✅ Yes.
    - Correct IDs, classes, and attributes: ✅ Yes.
    - Functionalities like adding, editing, deleting todos, filtering, and URL changes work as expected: ✅ Yes.

- **Good Practices:**

  - **Code Quality:** ✅ Code is generally well-written but could benefit from further refinement.

- **Event Handling:**

  - **Different from `addEventListener()`:** ⚠️ While you have an `on` function, ensure it does not internally use `addEventListener()` in a way that violates the requirement.

- **Conclusion:** You are likely to pass the audit, but addressing the suggestions above will increase your chances and demonstrate excellence.

## Detailed To-Do List with File Changes

Below is a comprehensive to-do list with detailed tasks and the files that need to be changed. Each task includes context to help you complete it effectively.

---

### 1. Implement the `off` Method in the Events System

**File to Change:** `src/core/events.js`

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Implement the `off` Function**
  - **Subtasks:**
    - [ ] Modify the `on` function to keep track of event listeners so they can be removed.
      - Store references to handlers in a map or a WeakMap.
    - [ ] Implement the `off` function to remove event listeners based on the event type, selector, and handler.
      - Use `document.removeEventListener()` with the stored handler reference.
    - [ ] Update documentation in `docs/README.md` to explain how to use `off`.

**Context:**

Currently, your `on` function attaches event listeners using event delegation but does not provide a way to remove them. Implementing `off` will allow users to remove event handlers when they are no longer needed, preventing potential memory leaks and unintended behavior.

---

### 2. Optimize State Comparison Logic

**File to Change:** `src/core/state.js`

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Enhance the `setState` Method**

    - [ ] Only call `this.notify()` if the state has actually changed.
    - [ ] Consider implementing immutable data structures or using a library like Immutable.js (optional).

- [ ] **Update Subscribers When Relevant Changes Occur**
  - **Subtasks:**
    - [ ] Modify subscribers to accept specific state slices or paths they're interested in.
